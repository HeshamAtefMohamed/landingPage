it's required to build navigation bar through  three steps

First:
 Build navigation bar
 by using dom by creating tags, appendChilds and iterating the the function which creates sections over the sections


Second:
which section is active while scrolling

third: 
to make smoothly scroll

I have searched and use refences like the following:
